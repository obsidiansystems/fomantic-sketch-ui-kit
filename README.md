# About

This is an open project to create a Sketch UI Kit for [Fomantic UI](https://fomantic-ui.com/) (previously [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)). Semantic UI development has been discontinued, but has been carried on as Fomantic UI.

# Making a Pull Request

Please follow the guidelines of the Sketch file when making a pull request. 

1. Organize your components using the same naming scheme as already exists.
2. Use existing Layer and Text Styles where possible.
3. Create new Layer and Text Styles for anything that can use them. Avoid creating one-off styles where possible, even if you only use the style once in your pull request.
4. Construct components so they can easily be modified using the built in Sketch overrides to achieve replicating the various states that Fomantic UI provides.
